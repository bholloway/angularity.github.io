The best place to start on project anatomy is to create a blank project.

Angularity has an [`init`](/tasks/init) task that will create a new project and initialise it. By default, it will
create a new subdirectory.

All Angularity tasks will have default values for any options. So we can go ahead and invoke `init` simply as below.

  angularity init

You will receive the following files.

![new project directory](/img/anatomy-directory.png)

## Composition Root

The `init` task will create an `/app` directory with files `index.html`, `index.js`, `index.scss`.

These files compose the primary application for this project. The entire `/app` directory should be version controlled.

> You can create additional applications in sub-folders. However they will be development only since they will
 not be deployed by the `release` task.

Angularity generates other directories as part of its build process. These are prefixed with `app`, such as `app-build`
and `app-test`. These generated directories should be ignored for version control.

All other directories are considered your local library. These files must be `require()`d or `@import`ed into `index.js`
or `index.scss` respectively.

## Git Ignore

Presuming you are using GIT, this file ensures version control will ignore generated directories and bower and npm
packages.

## JS Hint Config

A javascript linter is important to ensure code quality. Angularity uses [JS Hint](http://jshint.com/). The JS Hint
rule set is encoded in the `.jshintrc` file.

## Angularity Config

Angularity has a limited number of settings that control your project. These are found in `angularity.json`.

## Node and Bower Config

The composition roots may import from any node or bower packages. The `init` task creates basic `package.json` and
`bower.json` for node and bower respectively.

Each item in the bower `dependencies` map will be considered distributions and contribute directly to the HTML. Each
item in bower `devDependencies` will not contribute to the HTML but may be `require()`d or `@import`ed into the
composition roots.

Each item in the node package `depencencies` or `devDependencies` may be `require()`d or `@import`ed into the
composition roots. You may use the simple `require(<PACKAGE_NAME>)`, meaning that the experience is the same as
developing for the node platform.

## Karma Config

Angularity uses [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for unit tests. This is configured using `karma.conf.js`.

Since Angularity performs a build step, the `files` and `reporter` entries will be overwritten by Angularity to create a
derived file `/app-test/karma.conf.js`.

## ... Everything Else

The remaining directories (baring installed bower and node packages) are considered your local library.

There are no special directories for sprites, images, javascript, html partials, css and scss. It is up to you what
conventions you choose. However you organise these files, the composition root will import them will fully relative
paths.

Any file can also import from bower and node packages that are installed, much like you would do when developing for
the NodeJS platform.

This will be more apparent in the next section, when we look at an actual project.
