# ![Angularity Logo](/assets/logo.png) *Angularity*

> Angularity is a philosophy of development.

> Our focus is maintaining uniformity of development across groups of developers who hold varying experience levels.

> Our contributors hold a collective vision of best-practice AngularJS development and have condensed this into a set of
tools and resources known as **Angularity**.
